## IMPORTANT

This theme is developed for the gnome DE. It works on GTK3.22 to GTK3.29, and GTK3.32/34/36, NOT GTK 3.30.

How to install:

## Download the theme

> Gnome-PROF-light
>
> Gnome-PROF-light-DS (Dark Sidebar in the filemanager)
>
> Gnome-PROF-Darker
>
> Gnome-PROF-Dark

Just copy the extracted file to a '.themes'-folder you make in your home directory.
Then use Tweak Tool and select the theme.
LOG OUT AND BACK IN for changes to take full effect !

## IMPORTANT FOR UBUNTU-USERS

Ubuntu increasingly use snaps if you download something from the Ubuntu-software-center.
This unfortunately means that they do not follow the theme.
So some app's that are snaps use the default adwaita theme.
For example the Ubuntu-software-center is a snap-package and thus uses Adwaita, instead of Gnome-Prof-theme.
The only (easy) solution is to avoid snap-packages and find their versions in the repositories.
